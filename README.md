# ðŸ’« About Me:

Howdy! I'm an Electrical Engineer at Lynntech Inc., with a BS in Mechatronics Engineering from Texas A&M University.

I have a deep curiosity for technology, particularly in computers and electronics, which has led me to explore a wide range of fields, including 3D printing, robotics, home automation, and custom keyboard building. In my free time, I enjoy working with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, testing sensors and components to build innovative projects. I also run home servers and experiment with Proxmox virtualization, optimizing infrastructure for various applications. Additionally, I frequently collaborate with friends on their engineering endeavors, which has introduced me to exciting areas such as Underwater Autonomous Vehicles (AUVs).

Please feel free to checkout some of the projects I have worked on.
